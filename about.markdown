I am currently a Software Developer at Amazon. Some of my hobbies include Boxing, Skiing, playing Soccer and reading books. I've spent 36 hours on a US battleship traveling to Cryprus. 

I am currently teaching myself Machine Learning and I plan to post updates on my progress with this blog. If I find that Machine Learning and Data Science is a field I'm deeply interested I am considering pursing a Masters degree to explore the field further.

I'll mostly post about teaching myself Machine Learning, writing about intersting articles I've read and general summaries of my favorite books.

In the future I'll drop some of my favorite books and quotes here
